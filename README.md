## Calculator

Welcome to the Shock Wave Calculator, a tool designed for educational purposes to aid in the training of army sappers. This calculator utilizes Wang's physical modeling to simulate explosion shock waves and their effects.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to provide a user-friendly tool for army sappers to better understand and predict the behavior of explosion shock waves.

## Features

- **Wang's Physical Modeling:** Utilizes established physical models by Wang to accurately simulate explosion shock waves.
- **Customizable Parameters:** Users can input various parameters such as explosive mass and distance from the blast to tailor simulations to specific scenarios.
- **Interactive Visualization:** Visual representations of shock wave propagation and damage zones help users grasp the impact of explosive events.
- **Educational Resource:** Designed with educational purposes in mind, this tool serves as a valuable resource for training army sappers on blast effects and mitigation strategies.

## Usage

1. **Input Parameters:** Enter relevant parameters such as explosive yield, distance from the blast, and environmental factors.
2. **Run Simulation:** Initiate the simulation to generate shock wave data and visualize the results.
3. **Interpret Results:** Analyze the output to understand shock wave propagation, intensity levels, and potential damage zones.
4. **Refine and Learn:** Experiment with different parameters to observe how they affect the simulation outcomes. Use the tool as an educational resource to deepen understanding of explosion shock waves.
